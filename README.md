# Fine-Tuning BERT for Helpfulness Prediction in Online Reviews

Online review platforms often suffer from **information overload**, making it challenging for customers to evaluate product or business quality effectively during purchasing decisions. This repository presents a study that aims to address this problem by leveraging the **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model to predict the helpfulness of online customer reviews.

## Problem Statement

A large body of research has attempted to predict the helpfulness of online reviews, reporting contradictory findings regarding the effectiveness of various approaches. Many existing solutions rely on traditional machine learning techniques and handcrafted features, which often limit their generalizability.

## Proposed Solution

This study proposes a **generalized approach** by fine-tuning the BERT base model for classifying helpful and unhelpful reviews. The approach is evaluated using Yelp shopping reviews, and the performance is compared with traditional bag-of-words methods.

## Key Findings

1. **BERT Outperforms Traditional Methods**: Fine-tuned BERT classifiers significantly outperform bag-of-words approaches in classifying helpful and unhelpful reviews.
2. **Impact of Sequence Length**: The sequence length of the BERT-based classifier has a significant impact on classification performance.

## Methodology

- **Model**: BERT base model fine-tuning.
- **Dataset**: Yelp shopping reviews.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluations were conducted against bag-of-words approaches to assess performance.

## Results

The fine-tuned BERT-based classifiers demonstrated superior performance in accurately classifying reviews, highlighting their potential in solving the information overload issue on online review platforms.

## Future Work

Further research could explore:
- Incorporating additional datasets to improve generalizability.
- Experimenting with different transformer architectures.
- Investigating the impact of other hyperparameters on performance.
